# Swift Array Index Out of Bounds

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: accessing an element in an array using an index that is out of bounds.  This leads to a runtime error and program crash. The solution shows how to prevent this by using safe indexing techniques.

**bug.swift** contains the code that produces the error. 

**bugSolution.swift** provides corrected code that safely handles potential index out-of-bounds situations.
